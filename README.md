Hi!

This is a customer support multi agentic system for qest that has access to several tools like create_client, create_service, db_query, RAG and also implements effective dynamic switching to agents based on the user query. 
It implements short term memory too for a particular chat which can easily be converted to long term storage too.

For now, this system is capable of handling the following the questions the best:

- "Which course has the highest enrollment?" (db querying)  
- "What is the attendance percentage for Pilates?"  
- "Who is the instructor for the above mentioned course?" (Handles short-term memory for a particular session too)  
- "Create a new client with name Charles, email charles@gmail.com, phone number 7650289346." (create client tool)  
- "What can I expect on my first day?" (RAG component)
- "How old do you have to be to attend?" (RAG component)
- "How much revenue was generated in 2025?"
- "How much payment did we get?"  
- "Can you retrieve all of the data for the different payments that we have got?"

The only drawback:

Since this project requires GPU, and since I am not allowed to use AWS/Azure, I have deployed it using third party apps, but since it will be costly for me to keep it up all day, I request the reviewer to please contact me once before
testing the product out, so that I can quickly set up the backend before the demo.
