Hi!

This is a customer support multi agentic system for qest that has access to several tools like create_client, create_service, db_query, RAG and also implements effective dynamic switching to agents based on the user query. 
It implements short term memory too for a particular chat which can easily be converted to long term storage too.

For now, this system is capable of handling the following the questions the best:

- "Which course has the highest enrollment?" (db querying)  
- "What is the attendance percentage for Pilates?"  
- "Who is the instructor for the above mentioned course?" (Handles short-term memory for a particular session too)  
- "Create a new client with name Charles, email charles@gmail.com, phone number 7650289346." (create client tool)  
- "What can I expect on my first day?" (RAG component)
- "How old do you have to be to attend?" (RAG component)  
- "How much payment did we get?"  
- "Can you retrieve all of the data for the different payments that we have got?"  


Please do keep in mind the db formed was a synthetic one and with the current date format used it is not quite able to answer only the question "how much revenue was generated in 2025/ this month?".
- Due to the tight timeline, I could not work upon it, but changing the date format with different fields for year and month will be sufficient to overcome this problem.

Since this project requires GPU, and since I am not allowed to use AWS/Azure, I have deployed it using third party apps, but since it will be costly for me to keep it up all day, I request the reviewer to please contact me once before
testing the product out, so that I can quickly set up the backend before the demo.
